# Project Requirements:

- [ ]   Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from your own API built using json-server and a db.json file.
- [ ]   Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes.
- [ ]   Single HTML file
- [ ]   2 DISTINCT event listeners
- [ ]   One instance of array iteration using available array methods(map, forEach, filter, etc.)
- [ ]   Each event listener must have its own callback function using .addEventListener



# User Story

## MVP
As a user, I will be able to:
- [ ]   View recipes by area (cuisine) or category (dietary)
- [ ]   Get the details of a recipe by clicking on it

## Strech Goals
- [ ]   View recipes by main ingredient (form or search input)
- [ ]   View recipes by name (form or search input)
- [ ]   Save a recipe to a db.json file (would require deployment or json-server and db.json on Render)
